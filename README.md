A fork of Watchy. 

# Modifications

This is not at all compatible with the official version of Watchy. The watchfaces you've made for the other versions will not work on this one. 

You will instead need to inherit from the class called FaceFrame. 

But it's not (at this stage at least) made with the intent to be used by other people. It's usable as a clock right now but I've not included all the features from the original clock. 


# Compatibility issues

It seems like the watchy now has a new real-time clock, the code here will therefore only work on the old watchy clocks.
